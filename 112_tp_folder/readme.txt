This project is called BalanceCMU. It is a CMU Nutrition App meant to help CMU students plan out their meals at CMU. It keeps track of their nutrition information based on what they have eaten and their stats (height, weight, BMI, etc.) It logs all of the meals they have eaten while using the app, and shows a trajectory of calories, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats eaten throughout the week. It can be used to share the foods you have eaten on Facebook, and it has voice recognition features. It also has a recommendation feature, where it can recommend CMU foods to eat based on what they have eaten so far in the day, how much remaining calories, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats they have to eat, and their demonstrated meal preferences. It also includes a feature where you can add foods to your log that are not foods related to CMU dining.

To run the project, you simply need to run the file 'main.py'

The libraries I am using include:
1. PIL
2. speech_recognition
3. pyaudio
4. matplotlib
5. fbchat
6. collections
7. json

No shortcut commands.
